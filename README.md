# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model

This project implements the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model using Streamlit, providing users with an interactive interface to calculate and visualize call and put option prices for European-style options. The app allows users to input parameters and view option prices for different combinations of spot prices and volatilities in an interactive heatmap format.

## Features
- **User-friendly Sidebar**: Input fields to enter the parameters for the Black-Scholes model, including:
  - Current Price
  - Strike Price
  - Time to Maturity (in years)
  - Volatility (Ïƒ)
  - Risk-Free Interest Rate
- **Interactive Heatmap Parameters**: Users can specify ranges for spot prices and volatilities to generate heatmaps that visualize how option prices change with these variables.
- **Live Calculations**: Displays the calculated call and put option prices based on input parameters.
- **Heatmaps for Option Prices**: Heatmaps show the variation in call and put prices across specified ranges of spot prices and volatilities, helping users understand sensitivity to these variables.
